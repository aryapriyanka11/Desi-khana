# Desi-khana

About the Project :-

We can provide the dish in the Search bar. On clicking the search button beside the input bar. We will get the dishes related to the value present in search box. Every dish container will be having the image, name of the dish and the button used to add under favorite list and remove from the favourite list. The name of the dish in the dish card is a anchor tag, on clicking it navigates us to info page which has the Steps to cook. we have a button on the nav bar as well which takes us to favorite page, here we will be having all those items which are marked as favorite. This includes the dish car similar to home page and has the option to remove the dish from favorite list. We can navigate to Information page from here as well.Our Information page will be having a container which includes the image of the dish and instructions to cook it. We have two buttons either to navigate to home page or to favorite page from here as well
